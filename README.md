UKSDN Automated Network Test
=

this (program/set of programs) can be used to test our topology.
use python 2.7.5 (should work on 4 or 3).
also this package is dependent on an ssh library which Ill probably add to the install.
Keep in mind that I havent built the python part of this just yet so if you are confused as to why there is no python, dont worry
